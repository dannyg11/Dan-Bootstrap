            <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Problem with Networking</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">October 3rd, 2014</p>

            <p>
              My older brother recently got a job and in doing so was invited to a networking session with his company. To be fair, this wasn't one of those uber-awkward networking session networking sessions (yes, they exist!). It was a party for the firm, but tâ€™was understand amongst attendees that they were going there to network. Ok, glad that's out of the way. When I spoke to him following the event he went on about how awful it was, and how much he despised networking. I could sympathize. Networking, for me, is about 3 row below the dentist visits. It's the kind of word that makes me want to vomit. It's awful and I hate everything about...but why?

</p><p>After discussing this with my brother at length, I was able to narrow down what was really so awful about networking. It's not necessary talking to people that is so dreadful. I love talking to people, and at times tend to be a bit long-winded. Nope. It's not that. It's not that you are meeting new people and building valuable connections. No, I think most people would like to have as many connections as possible. I think what it really comes down to, for most of us, is that it's so horribly and ridiculously fake.

</p><p>Why are we pretending we are friends, pretending we are actually interested in learning where each other's second cousin went to high school; when we both know we are there for one reason. Can't we just cut to the chase? Apparently not, As there are people who have been doing this forever, and other who have pretty much made a career out of networking. They say this is the way it's done, and we should probably listen. So, where does that leave people like my brother, me, and the rest of the awkward turtles out there? Well, probably screwed as it's difficult to find success in business while having the networking skills of a squirrel. Or, is it?</p>

<p>I'd like to think that networking isn't black and white, and making real connections doesn't consist of simply sniffing butts. With respect to tech startups, I don't think master-networkers are at a definite advantage. In fact, I'd argue that they might be at a disadvantage. These types do really well in corporate America -- they become our bosses, managers, administrators, etc. However, in a field that relies on doing an insane amount with extremely limited resources, I don't know if there is room for gabbers and ball-lickers. So, does that mean people who want to work/found tech startups shouldn't network? Absolutely not.</p>

<p>It means that you should be genuine and never put on a facade. It means that you should try to enter fields you are actually interested in. It means that you should probably avoid blatant flattery. So, am I saying that I actually have a one up on the more outgoing types. Not really. I'm still a shy person, and not entirely willing to reach out to people I don't know. That said, when I do reach out it is because I am truly interested in getting to know someone, sharing thoughts on different ideas and gaining knowledge I didn't have prior. I think that's pretty valuable. Well, I hope it is. Because I'm not willing to fake it.</p>
